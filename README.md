# MSE2202-Project-2015
Here it is, the Github for the dream team 

Ok team I have very high hopes for this project but there are some key things that will make the overall experience better IMO. 
These are just the thoughts I have so please dont be discouraged if you think you have a better approach :) #goTeam

1) Github
I've spent some time trying to figure out how to effectively use Github and im gonna talk to Naish Monday but heres how Im understanding this will work best (because there multiple ways you can organize projects and collabourations)
  
  I created an organiztion and will add you all as owners (this gives everyone FULL rights/administrative access to everything in the organition, just be careful if you need to delete..). I also created a repository for our project. Currnently it only has two branches: Master (this is for 100% debugged and working code) and Dev (essentially the in progress code). I think it might also be best to create an individual branch for each of us. This would allow us to work up multiple parts simulaniously (one could work on door opening while another person works on locating waterbottle etc). It would also mean one of use working on our own does not need to worry about ruining working code by adding new steps (their personal branch can be tested before pushing to Dev). an alternate approach could be making branches for different steps in the course (ie door stage, newspaper stage) 

  From here I'm not quite sure which of two opions would be best to take since we all have full access. 
    a) you will all need to clone the repository to your computer (this is so you can do work on your own computer offline).
  I believe, because we all have full access, that after this you can edit/commmit/pull/push/sync any branch on your own    and   it will change the main repository.
    b) we may however have to fork the main repository (from the organization) to our own Github account, then clone the forked   repository (in your personal account) onto your computer. If done this way you can edit/commit/pull/push/sync with your         personal repository, but then must create a pull request in order to make these changes on the main repository.
